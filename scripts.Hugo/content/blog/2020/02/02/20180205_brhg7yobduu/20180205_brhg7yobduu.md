{{< mydiv text="机器驴2_Inventions_World:9 Advanced Robots From Boston Dynamics Will Change The Jobs Of Humans. -Boston Dynamics Robot  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Join Amazon Prime For Amazing Offers(Free 30 Days Trial) : http://amzn.to/2HjTpKM -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  1. BigDog The First Advanced Rough-Terrain Robot The first legged robot to leave the lab and take on the real world. BigDog has four legs that are articulated like an animal’s, with compliant elements to absorb shock and recycle energy from one step to the next. BigDog is the size of a large dog or small mule.  2. SpotMini Good Things Come in Small Packages A nimble robot that handles objects, climbs stairs, and will operate in offices, homes and outdoors. SpotMini is a small four-legged robot that comfortably fits in an office or home.  It weighs 25 kg (30 kg if you include the arm). SpotMini is all-electric and can go for about 90 minutes on a charge, depending on what it is doing.  3. Atlas The World s Most Dynamic Humanoid Atlas uses balance and whole-body skills to achieve two-handed mobile manipulation. Atlas is the latest in a line of advanced humanoid robots we are developing.  Atlas  control system coordinates motions of the arms, torso and legs to achieve whole-body mobile manipulation, greatly expanding its reach and workspace.  Atlas  ability to balance while performing tasks allows it to work in a large volume while occupying only a small footprint.  4. Handle Legs & Wheels: The Best of Both Worlds Handle combines wheels and legs to provide agile high-strength mobile manipulation. Handle is a robot that combines the rough-terrain capability of legs with the efficiency of wheels. It uses many of the same principles for dynamics, balance, and mobile manipulation? found in the quadruped and biped robots we build, but with only 10 actuated joints, it is significantly less complex. Wheels are fast and efficient on flat surfaces while legs can go almost anywhere: by combining wheels and legs, Handle has the best of both worlds.  5. Spot Takes a Kicking and Keeps on Ticking Spot takes the lessons learned developing BigDog, Cheetah and LS3, and rolls them into a quiet four-legged robot with extraordinary rough terrain mobility and super-human stability. Spot is a four-legged robot designed for indoor and outdoor operation.  It has been the breeding ground for a new approach to dynamic robot control that brings true autonomy within reach.  6. LS3 Legged Squad Support Systems The AlphaDog of legged robots carries heavy loads over rough terrain. LS3 was designed to go anywhere Marines and soldiers go on foot, helping carry their load. LS3 carries 182 kg of gear and enough fuel for a 32 km mission lasting 24 hours.  (In one test on flat terrain LS3 carried over 500 kg of payload.)  LS3 automatically follows its leader using computer vision, so it does not need a dedicated driver.  7. WildCat The World’s Fastest Quadruped Robot WildCat - the fastest quadruped robot on Earth. It runs 32 km/h while maneuvering and maintaining its balance. WildCat uses a galloping gait much like a dog or horse and leans into turns in order to maintain traction and balance.  8. SandFlea Leaps Small Buildings in a Single Bound Sand Flea drives like an RC car on flat terrain, but jumps 10 m into the air to overcome obstacles. Sand Flea is a small robot with 4 wheels and a mighty jumping leg.  It drives like an RC car on flat terrain, but can jump 10 m into the air to jump over obstacles.  9. RHex Devours Rough Terrain RHex is a passively-stable six-legged robot with high mobility. RHex is a six-legged robot with remarkable mobility on rough terrain. "
